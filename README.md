# SoT-DLC
Sea of Thieves ESP and Cannon Prediction using Doug's Framework

## Disclaimer
This is not a public display or release of features but instead a reference point.
I will not give you the full codebase or files/modules of my code.
At Doug's request, I will not be sharing any solutions or code directly.

## Features
- Ship ESP and Prediction (Cannonball and Chainshot)
- Player ESP (Name/Health)
- Sunk Percentage
- Number of holes
- Hole locations

## What is this repo
In this repo I will explain how I wrote modules for doug's framework that can display the above features. This is essentially a combination of information from unknowncheats threads and my own knowledge.

## Mogistink
Mogistink is a god who explained cannon prediction in [this post](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3408459-post25.html). His explanation is excellent and is the basis of my implementation. There are, however, some slight differences.

## Doug's Framework
Doug wrote the framework that all of my modules run on. It allows us to get information from the game and display it on the screen.
